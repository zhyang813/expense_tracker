### Notes
- Basic functions are done
- Allow two types of users: regular users and admins
- Expense record consists of datetime, amount, description, and owned by one user
- Report view is functional but lacks of by week view, more time and data needed
- Truly SPA
- Some tests are provided, due to time limit, test coverage is low
- 6-7 hours were spent on this, had hard time finding more time and a quiet place to keep woring on the project
